    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to recurring patterns or fluctuations in a time series that vary systematically over time. Unlike fixed or constant seasonal patterns, time-dependent seasonal components acknowledge that the amplitude or shape of seasonal effects may change as time progresses. This recognizes the dynamic nature of seasonality, allowing for variations in the strength or duration of seasonal patterns across different periods."
